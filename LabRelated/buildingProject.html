<h2>Building a Project</h2>
<hr />
<p>After creating a new project solution, adding files, and changing settings, you are now ready to build the project, which causes all the .cpp files to be compiled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiling the entire project -

<ul>
<li>From the menu bar choose: <em>Build | Build Lab</em></li>
<li>If you always use the Build LX.exe command, Visual C++ will only compile those files that have changed since the last time you compiled the project. This will save you time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The executable file, (i.e., the .EXE) will be located in the DEBUG subdirectory.</li>
</ul>
<table style="width: 100%;" border="0">

<ul>
<li>You can also compile just one file at a time.
<ul>
<li>To compile one file at a time (instead of the entire project), from the Solution Explorer window right click on the .CPP file that needs compiling, choose "Compile" from the quick menu.</li>
<li>In the screen shot to the right, the right click was on the Driver.cpp file.</li>
