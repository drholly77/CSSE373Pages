<h2>Building a Project</h2>
<hr />
<p>After creating a new project solution, adding files, and changing settings, you are now ready to build the project, which causes all the .cpp files to be compiled and a .exe file to be created</p>

<ul>
<li>When in Debug configuration, the executable file (i.e., the .exe file) will be generated by the build and stored in the project's Debug subfolder</li>
<li>When in Release configuration, then the .exe will be stored in the project's Release subfolder</li>
</ul>
