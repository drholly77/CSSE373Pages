<h2>How to Turn in a Project Assignment</h2>
<hr />
<p>On or before the Project assignment's appointed due date (see Canvas assignment for exact due date) turn in your Project X&nbsp;by doing the three steps listed below.</p>
<p>Note: substitute P1, P2, etc., for PX in the following. For example, if you are working on Project 1, substitute P1 for PX.</p>
<table style="width: 100%;" border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><ol>
<li>While in Visual Studio&nbsp;working on PX, do the following:<ol type="a">
<li>In Debug configuration, run the <em>Clean</em> operation.&nbsp; From the menu bar choose: <code>Build | Clean Solution</code></li>
<li>Now switch  to Release configuration and run the <em>Clean</em> operation</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Switch from Visual Studio to Windows File Explorer to&nbsp;do the following:<ol type="a">
<li>Navigate to the <code>C:\CppDev\PX</code> folder and if either of the following files are present delete them: &quot;PX.VX.db&quot; or "PX.sdf"<br /> 
  This file is large and will slow down uploading and downloading. Visual Studio creates this file automatically, and will easily recreate it when it needs it</li>
<li>Navigate to the <code>C:\CppDev</code> folder, and right click on the PX folder, and choose: <br /> Send to | Compressed (zipped) Folder<br />This will create the file: PX.zip (it should be approximately 100 KB or less in size)<br /><em>See screen shot to the right</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Finally, you must upload the .zip created in Step 2 (above). To do this, log into&nbsp;Canvas, navigate to the PX Assignment, click "Submit Assignment", and follow the on screen instructions in order to upload you PX.zip file</li>
