<body>

<h4>1) C343 uses C++ and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 for the lab assignments.</h4>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>C343 will be using Microsoft's Visual Studio Community 2015 this semester for our C++ development environment.</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: You <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> use Visual Studio 2015. You will be supplied with&nbsp;libraries compiled by VS 2015, and your lab submissions will be compiled for grading by the grader using VS 2015. If either of these two types of work fail because you are using a different version, your lab will earn a 0% for a grade</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>For this lab&nbsp;assignment:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Download (for free) Visual Studio Community 2015 from Microsoft's DreamSpark web site.</li>
<li>Install Visual Studio Community 2015 on the machine you'll be working on this fall semester.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>IU has a Knowledge Base entry on how to use DreamSpark (<a href="http://kb.iu.edu/data/axjl.html)The">http://kb.iu.edu/data/axjl.html)</a></li>
<li>The download (from #1 above) comes in an .iso file, which means you'll need to burn it to a DVD.</li>
<li>Then install Visual Studio from the DVD.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2) Setup CppDevFa15 Folder</h4>
<hr />

<h5>Overview</h5>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;CppDevFa15 folder contains software components that you will be using this semester when writing your software and it is where you will store all your C343 software development&nbsp;lab assignments.</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: versions of this folder prior to CppDevFa15 will fail to work correctly, do not use any of these versions.</li>
</ul>
<li>Place this folder on your computer's C:\ drive, and work exclusively from this folder all semester.&nbsp; (Recommended)</li>
<li>Alternatives to working exclusively from your computer's C:\ drive:
<ol type="a">
<li>Work from your C:\ drive, but when you need to work on another computer, copy the CppDevFa15 folder from your C:\ drive to a USB flash drive. Temporarily work from the flash drive, then when done, copy the CppDevFa15 folder back onto your C:\ drive.</li>
<li>If you are going to use multiple computers, you might choose to work exclusively from a USB flash drive. With this option, you will work on all you software development labs from this flash drive. The drawback with this option is that all file manipulations will be much slower including compiling, editing, and&nbsp;saving.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Instructions</h5>
<ol>
<li>To download, click on the following zip file and save it to your computer's hard drive:&nbsp;<a id="" class=" instructure_file_link" title="CppDevSp15.zip" href="/courses/1451923/files/55181379/download?wrap=1" data-api-endpoint="https://iu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/1451923/files/55181379" data-api-returntype="File">CppDevFa15.zip</a></li>
<li>Once it is downloaded, navigate to inside the .zip by double clicking on it.</li>
<li>Once inside the zip, copy the folder found inside (called "CppDevFa15") to your C:\ drive.</li>
<li>After it&nbsp;is placed onto your C:\ drive,&nbsp;it should look like the screen shot to the right.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Final Note:</h4>
<p>If you are an IU Southeast student, you can always do your work on an IU Southeast computer lab machine. You do not have to work on your own personal machine.</p>
