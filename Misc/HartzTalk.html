<h1>COMPUTER SCIENCE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING SEMINAR</h1>
  <h2>Hacking Python Bytecode for Fun And...Well, Maybe Just for Fun</h2>

<p>When the Python interpreter executes a program, it does so by first converting the human-readable source code to an intermediate representation known as bytecode, which is the representation that is actually executed by the interpreter.  In this talk, I'll provide a brief introduction to Python bytecode and how it is interpreted, and I'll also demonstrate examples of analyzing and/or manipulating this representation in order to better understand (or modify!) details of Python's interpretation of the code.</p>
