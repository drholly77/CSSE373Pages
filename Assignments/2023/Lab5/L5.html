<h1>Implementing a Component in Raw C++</h1>

<hr>
<h3>1. Setup</h3>
<h4>1.1 Recommendation</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Work in L3 project, but modify IntegerList.h so that it #includes "List\List0.hpp" (see below concerning creation of List0.hpp) and change IntegerList.h so that it makes the instance from List0 instead of List2</li>
          <li>Alternatively, you may decide to start from scratch and make your own project for this lab, e.g., naming it L5</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The primary objective of this lab is to provide you experience  with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Layering a component (e.g., List) in Raw C++</li>
          <li>Creating an internal representation that supports specified performance requirements</li>
          <li>Creating a component that is a good steward of heap allocated memory, i.e., your component does not create garbage</li>
          <li>Experience first hand the creation of a deep copy of a variable's value<br>
            <br>
          </li>

<h4>2.2 Specifics</h4>
        <p><em>Steps</em>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Use Queue0.hpp as a guide for creating List0<br>
            I recommend that
          you copy Queue0.hpp (located in <code>components\include\Queue</code>) to List0.hpp </li>
          <li>Place List0.hpp in <code>components\include\List</code> folder<br>
			  Note: When grading, the grader will look for List0.hpp in <code>components\include\List</code>, if it is not found there, you will earn a zero</li>
          <li>Implement all of List's Standard and Specific methods in List0.hpp<br>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>List specific requirements</em>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You must used C++'s nodes and pointer types similar to how it is done in Queue0.hpp</li>
          <li>Your internal representation is up to you, just so long as your implementation meets the following performance requirements:</li>
			<ul>
          <li>All <em>List Standard Operations</em> must work in constant time, i.e., &theta;(1)<br>
            Except for the following which will work in &theta;(N) time, where N = length of the list:<br>
            (1) <em>operator = </em> in order to deallocate the left hand side list, and to copy the right hand side list<br>
            (2) <em>transferFrom</em> in order to deallocate the list that receives the transfer, but for no other reason<br>
            (3) <em>clear</em> in order to deallocate all the controlling variable list<br>
            (4) ~<em>List0()</em> in order to deallocate the list when it goes out of scope <br>
          </li>
          <li>All <em>List Specific Operations</em> must work in constant time, i.e., &theta;(1)</li>
          <li>If you fail to meet these performance requirements, then the operation will be deemed incorrect</li>
		    </ul>
			<li>Your implementation must deallocate all nodes that it allocates from heap (see Queue0 for examples of where and how)<br>
			If your implementation fails to correctly deallocate nodes, then it will create garbage, and for each operation that fails to correctly deallocate nodes, those operations will be deemed incorrect</li>
			<li>You must make a deep copy when implementing <em>operator =</em>. No shallow copies. If you create shallow copies, via aliasing, then your operation will be deemed incorrect.</li>
        </ul>
<p><em>Important Restrictions</em>:</p>
<ol>


  <li><strong>Use Design by Contract</strong> - No defensive programming of List's operations</li>
  <ul>
    <li>What this means is that the implementation of a List operation must not contain code that checks to make sure that the List operation was called correctly by a client program</li>
  </ul>
	<li><strong>Write elegant client code</strong> - Eliminate code duplication, have no unused variables, no left over Queue0 code or comments, etc.</li>
 
  <li><strong>No Cross Calling - </strong>None of List's member functions are permitted to make calls to any of the other <em>public</em> List member functions, i.e., no cross calling
    <ul>
      <li>All List operations should directly manipulate List's data members </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Calling Down</strong> - is encouraged (but not required) by creating private member functions that capture code that starts to appear in multiple different places in your List0 implementation. Do this to avoid the duplication of  code</li>
  <li><strong>No Recursion</strong> - None of List's member functions are permitted to be recursive</li>
  <li><strong>About Making Copies</strong> - The only time you should be making a copy of anything is when you implement <em>operator =</em>.<br>
	  For this, you will need to create a duplicate linked list (see Queue0's implementation) and you will call template parameter T's <em>operator =</em> to make copies of the data

  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Testing 
    <ul>
      <li>L3R contains the test scripts for testing a List in Release mode, you can use these</li>
      <li>Develop more test cases to achieve good boundary condition testing, or any other aspect you deem will help reveal defects</li>

<p><em>The Grader's test cases</em>:</p>
<p>Grading will be done running a more complete set of unit tests which will systematically stress your member function implementations</p>
