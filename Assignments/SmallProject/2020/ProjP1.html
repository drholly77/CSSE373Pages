<h3>1. Setup</h3>
<h4>1.1 Get the ProjP1Starter Download</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Download <em>ProjP1Starter.zip</em>&nbsp;to your machine - to be used on a subsequent steps</li>
</ul>
<h4>1.2 Copy Sequence3.hpp from the ProjP1Starter.zip</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Inside ProjP1Starter.zip is a file named Sequence3.hpp
    <ul>
      <li>For this assignment you will be making changes to this file</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Copy this file to the following folder on your machine <em>CppDevSp20/components/include/Sequence </em></li>
</ul>
<h4>1.3  Use Project L5Driver</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use VisualStudio to open the L5Driver project (from assignment L5) </li>
  <li>At the top of <em>driver.cpp</em>, change the #include so that it obtains Sequence3.hpp instead of Sequence2.hpp</li>
  <li>L5Driver will build correctly if you have followed the instructions in 1.1 - 1.2 (above)</li>
</ul>

        <p>The primary objective of this lab is to provide you experience  with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Layering a component on BinaryTree1 component</li>
          <li>This implementation of Sequence will require you to write recursive operations</li>
          <li>This will provide us the opportunity to talk about formal methods in the context of recursive operations</li>
          <li>Note: this implemenation will not maintain a balanced binary tree</li>

<h4>2.2 Specifics</h4>
<p><em>Steps</em>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start Visual Studio</li>
  <li>Open project L5Driver</li>
  <li>Implement each Sequence3 member functions - use the L5Driver command interpreter to test your implementation<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Hints</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sequence3's <em>add</em> operation has already been implemented for you, use it as a guide</li>
  <li>Implement all of Sequence3's stubbed out member functions</li>
  <li>Look for the TODO comments in Sequence3.hpp</li>
  <li>Reference the Sequence layered on Binary Tree instructional materials</li>
  <li>Reference the Sequence and BinaryTree specifications</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Important Restrictions</em>:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Obey the correspondence </strong>- When implementing the member functions you must obey the correspondence internal contract<br>
    That means: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>assume that the correspondence holds when the member function is called</li>
    <li>guarantee that the correspondence holds when the member function exits</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Use Design by Contract</strong> - No defensive programming of Sequence's operations</li>
  <ul>
    <li>What this means is that the implementation of a Sequence operation must not contain code that checks to make sure that the Sequence operation was called correctly by the client</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>No Cross Calling - </strong>None of Sequence's member functions are permitted to make calls to any of the other <em>public</em> Sequence member functions, i.e., no cross calling
    <ul>
      <li>All Sequence operations should directly manipulate Sequence's data members </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Calling Down</strong> - is encouraged (but not required) by creating private member functions that capture code that starts to appear in multiple different places in your Sequence3 implementation. Do this to avoid the duplication of  code</li>
  <li><strong>Recursion</strong> - You must used recursion for all private member functions</li>
  <li><strong>About Making Copies</strong> -
    <ul>
      <li>When implementing Sequence3's <em>operator =</em> you must use the internal component's <em>operator =</em> to make a copy of the data members</li>
      <li>Otherwise do not call <em>operator =</em> with the Sequence3 data members or with variables of type T</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>3. Testing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>At a minimum, use L5Driver for your testing
    <ul>
      <li>1st - Recommended that you test in Debug mode </li>
      <li>2nd - Recommended that you test in Release mode</li>
      <li>Like on the previous lab, if you'd like to share your testing scripts or ideas, please feel free to do so</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>4. Grading Guidelines</h3>
<h4>Failure of Your Submission to Correctly Compile - 100 out of 100 points</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If your submission does not compile correctly so that I cannot run my test cases, zero points will be earned</li>
</ul>
<h4>Violation of "Important Restrictions" (see above) - 40 points maximum</h4>
<ul>
  <li>8 points each up to 40 points</li>
</ul>
<h4>Operation Implementations - 60 points maximum</h4>
<ul>
  <li>6 points off for each incorrect operation listed in the check list below that does not meet its ensures clause, not to exceed 60 points</li>
  <li>Note: this implemenation will not maintain a balanced binary tre</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Submitting the Lab for Grading</h3>
<p>Upload a completed<em> Sequence3.hpp </em>file to the <em>ProjP1</em> Moodle assignment</p>
