<h2>1. Command Interpreter Using an Array</h2>
<p>Make a command interpreter that works with an array of Sequences instead of
  just two Sequences.&nbsp; This permits the user at the keyboard to work with more than two 
  Sequences, and it actually reduces the amount of code in our command interpreter.</p>
	<p>Even in today's world of JUnit type testing, command interpreters come in quite handy for testing modules that are difficult to test using JUnit tests. Usually these modules are buried deep in a large application, and it is difficult to create JUnit tests that create the correct kind of test inputs.</p>
<h4>Setup Steps:</h4>

	    <p>For Steps 1 - 5 (below) reference the following web page <a href="https://drholly77.github.io/CSSE373Pages/LabRelated/" target="_blank">Creating and building empty projects</a></p>
		  <ol>
          <li><strong>Create</strong> a new Visual Studio Empty Project, name the project <em>L1</em> and make it subordinate to the csse373devenv202530-YourUserID repo folder</li>
          <li><strong>Copy</strong> (don't move) 4 items from the <u>csse373devenv202530-YourUserID/SeqDriver</u> folder to the newly created L1 folder (created by VisualStudio in Step 1):
			  <ol><li><em>driver.cpp</em></li>
				  <li><em>TextSeq.h</em></li>
				  <li><em>TestFolder</em> - a folder</li>
				  <li><em>TestScripts</em> - a folder</li>
			  </ol></li>
          <li><strong>Add</strong> .cpp files to your project's Source Files folder:
		    <ol><li>First add the <em>driver.cpp</em> (that you copied) to the project's Source Files folder</li>
				  <li>Then add the wrapper folder (VS calls it a filter) and its subordinate .cpp files.</li> 
				  </ol></li>
          <li><strong>Add</strong> a .h file to your project's Header Files folder:
		    <ul><li><em>TextSeq.h</em></li>
			  <li>When finished with this step, your project should look like the screen shot to the right.</li></ul>
			  </li>
          <li><strong>Change</strong> the project settings</li>
          <li><strong>Build</strong> the project. If all steps up to this point were done correctly, it should build without any errors&nbsp;</li>
          <li>To run this program click: <em>Debug | Start Debugging</em> from the menu bar in Visual Studio</li>

<h4>Overview of What To Do:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>driver.cpp</em> that you copied from the SeqDriver folder is a client program of the Sequence4 component</li>
  <li>Both client program and Sequence4 component follow the Design by Contract approach where the client program is responsible for making sure that the precondition (<em>requires</em> clause) for the called operation (from the Sequence component) is satisfied prior to making a call. Also, the Sequence component's exported operations do not check to make sure that the client has called correctly, they are implemented with the assumption that the client has called with all preconditions satisfied.</li>
  <li>The client program in <em>driver.cpp</em> works with two Sequences, s1 and s2</li>
  <li>Your job is to modify each of the <em>driver.cpp</em> operations that currently work with s1 and s2 so that after modification it works with one variable which is a StaticArray of Sequences instead of two distinct sequence variables</li>
</ul>
<h4>To Do Specifics:</h4>
<ol>
  <li><em>driver.cpp</em> #include's <em>TextSeq.h</em>. You'll first modify TextSeq.h to make it create a StaticArray of Sequences (the code for this is below in Section 2.1)</li>
  <li>Then move on to <em>main</em> - see Section 2.2</li>
  <li>Then change all operations that end up being called by <em>main</em>, e.g., the <em>commandController</em>, <em>dispatchCommand</em>, the <em>do</em> operations, etc. - see Section 2.3</li>
  <li>Also, you must  modify <em>getIndex</em> - see Section 2.4 </li>
</ol>
<h2>2. Code Examples</h2>
<h3>2.1 - Creating a StaticArray of Sequences of Text</h3>
<p>Use the following example as a guide to creating an Array of Sequences, make these changes in  <em>TextSeq.h</em></p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
    <table border="1" width="55%">
      <tr>
        <td  valign="top"><code><font size="2">// Array of Sequence&lt;Text&gt;<br>
          // Date: 3/2025<br>
          <br>
          #<b>include</b> &quot;Sequence/Sequence4.hpp&quot;<br>
          #<b>include</b> &quot;StaticArray/StaticArray1.hpp&quot;<br>
          <br>
          // First create a named instance of Sequence that holds Text objects
			<br>
          <b>typedef</b> Sequence4&lt;Text&gt; TextSequence;<br>
          <br>
			// No Magic Numbers allowed
			<br>
			// So use enum to give names to the array lower and upper bounds, and size
		 <br>
		  <strong>enum</strong> {lowerBound = 0, upperBound = 4, arraySize = 5};<br>
          // Create named instance called ArrayOfSequences, which is indexed from 0..4<br>
          <b>typedef</b> StaticArray1&lt;TextSequence, lowerBound, upperBound&gt; ArrayOfSequences;</font></code></td>
   
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
</div>
<h3>2.2 - Changes to <em>main</em> - the <em>main</em> below is ready to go, use it to replace L1's main in driver.cpp</h3>
<div align="center">
  <center>
    <table border="1" width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><code><font size="2"><b>int</b> main (int argc, char* 
          argv[])<br>
          {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; Boolean showMenu = (argc == 1);<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; ArrayOfSequences aS1;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; commandController (aS1, showMenu);<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>return</b> 0;<br>
          }	// end main</font></code></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
</div>
<h3>2.3 - Changes to: commandController, dispatchCommand, and the <em>do</em> operations</h3>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><ul>
        <li>Below is the code for <em>doAdd</em>,  replace driver.cpp's existing doAdd with the code below</li>
        <li>Pay attention to doAdd's parameters, many of the other operations are parameterized similarly</li>
        <li>The screenshot to the right shows the headers for all the operations including their parameters</li>
        <li>The operations inscribed by the green rectangles in the screenshot to the right must be modified to work with the ArrayOfSequences</li>
        <li>I recommend  taking an incremental approach to making these changes (i.e., not a <em>big bang</em> approach)
			<ol>
				<li>Use mutli-line comments, i.e., /* ... */, to comment out all the <em>do</em> operations except <em>doAdd</em></li>
				<li>Change out the code for <em>doAdd</em> using the code below</li>
				<li>Proceed with updating the <em>getIndex</em> operation</li>
				<li>Then update the <em>commandController</em> operation</li>
				<li>Followed by the <em>dispatchCommand</em> operation.<br>
					When working on <em>dispatchCommand</em> comment out all the cases that make calls to the <em>do</em> operations that you commented out in #1 (above)</li>
				<li>Get the project to build and run with just the new <em>doAdd</em></li>
				<li>Then, one at a time, work on the remaining <em>do</em> operations, e.g., <em>doClear</em>, <em>doRemove</em>, etc.</li>
			</ol><br>
		</li>
      </ul></td>

    <table border="2" width="95%">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><pre><strong>void</strong> doAdd (ArrayOfSequences&amp; aS)   
// Note: the '&amp;' after the ArrayOfSequences type name means 'pass by reference' in C++

} // doAdd</pre></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
</div>
<h3>2.4 - Changes to <em>getIndex</em> operation</h3>
<p>Change <em>getIndex</em> (in driver.cpp) so that it requires the user to type in a
  number that can legally index into the ArrayOfSequences, but not allow indices 
  outside the bounds of the array</p>
<ul>
  <li>Change <em>getIndex</em>'s header to so that it takes the array of Sequences as a parameter - you can see a legal call to <em>getIndex</em> in the<em> doAdd</em> example above</li>
  <li>In <em>getIndex</em> use StaticArray's <em>getBounds</em> operation to determine the number of
    locations in the array, just in case we later decide to change the array size&nbsp;<br>
    <code>Integer lowerB, upperB;<br>
    aS.getBounds (lowerB, upperB);<br>
    // use lowerB and upperB to tell the user what the bounds
    are&nbsp;<br>
    // and to check to make sure the user supplied a good index</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Testing</h2>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><p>After a successful build, run your program by clicking <em>Debug | Start Debugging</em> from the menu bar in Visual Studio. This will bring up a window similar to the one to the right</p>
        <p>You can test the program at least 2 different ways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Run the program and type in your commands at the command prompt to exercise each of the<em> </em>operations that were modified, e.g., <em>doAdd</em><br><br></li>
          <li>The <em>TestScripts</em> folder contains numerous .txt files:
			  <ul>
			  <li>Each .txt contains commands to be input into your command interpreter. They all work for the original SeqDriver implementation (which uses only two Sequences, s1 and s2). </li>
			  <li>Instead of retyping commands each time you run your command interpreter, you can run it and then copy and paste these tests scripts into your command interpreter while its running - it will execute all the commands that you paste in</li>
			  <li>If you utilize these test scripts, you'll need to first study them to understand what they are asking the command interpreter to do, and then modify <em>some</em> of them slightly to work with your command interpreter that uses an <em>array</em> of sequences. The ones that require modifying are the ones that work on two sequences, e.g., append, split, etc.</li></ul>
			<br>The <em>TestFolder</em> contains the following:
			  <ul>
				  <li><em>L1Sol.exe</em> which is a solution to this lab</li>
				  <li><em>runScripts.bat</em> which is Windows batch file which will run all the test scripts (one after another) on either L1Sol.exe, or your L1.exe</li>
				  <li>To learn how to use <em>runScripts.bat</em>, navigate to this folder and read the <em>AAAreadme.txt</em> file and the code comments in <em>runScripts.bat</em></li>
				  <li><strong>Note</strong>: You must make your <em>L1.exe</em> run exactly like <em>L1Sol.exe</em>.
				  <br>
				  In the <b>Grading</b> section below you will find out what is meant by <i>exactly</i></li>

<h2>4. Grading</h2>
<p>In the <em>TestFolder</em> folder  is <em>L1Sol.exe</em>. This executable is my solution to L1.</p>
<p>Your submission will be graded by running various test scripts against your <em>L1.exe</em> and then using FC (a File Compare tool) to compare the output from your <em>L1.exe</em> against the output from <em>L1Sol.exe</em>. FC does a character by character comparison.</p>
<p>It's highly recommend that you do not try to use the <em>eyeball method</em> compare your <em>L1.exe</em>'s output with the output from <em>L1Sol.exe</em> because FC detects all character differences, even whitespace differences. I recommend that you run both L1.exe and L1Sol.exe on the test scripts found in <em>TestScripts</em>, and compare the two outputs against each other using FC. You are finished when FC reports &quot;no differences found&quot;.</p>
