<h1>Layering an Operation</h1>


	
<h3>1. Setup</h3>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">
		  <h4>1.1 Get the L6RStarter Download</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Download <em>L6RStarter.zip</em>&nbsp;to your machine - to be used in subsequent steps</li>
        </ul>
		  <h4>1.2 Copy AppendCapabilitiy1.hpp from the L6RStarter.zip</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Inside L6RStarter.zip is a file named AppendCapabilitiy1.hpp
            <ul>
              <li>Copy this file into your: <em>csse373devenv202x30-yourID\components\include\Queue</em></li>
				<li>AppendCapabilitiy1.hpp contains a fully functional Queue <em>append</em> operation and uses C++ template syntax that allows layering of this operation onto the Queue component</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
         
        </ul>
        <h4>1.3 Copy the L6R Folder from the L6RStarter.zip</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Inside L6RStarter.zip is a folder named L6R </li>
			    <ul>
          <li>Copy the L6R folder to your <em>csse373devenv202x30-yourID</em> folder as shown in the screen shot to the right</li>
          <li>Once you have copied this folder you can use VS2022 to open the L6R project by double clicking on L6R.sln  </li>
			</ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>1.4 About Project L6R</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>It contains a Visual Studio 2022 unit test project</li>
          <li>It can be opened with VS2022 by double clicking on the file L6R.sln</li>
          <li>It will build correctly if you have followed the instructions in 1.1 - 1.3 (above)</li>
			<li>After building, use Test Explorer to run the unit tests found in L6R.cpp</li>
          <li>L6R contains unit tests for Queue's AppendCapability, InjectCapability, FindLocOfXCapability, and EqualCapability</li>
			<li>The files you will be working in are: 
			<ol><li>EnhancedIntQ.h - Contains "To do" instructions and typedefs for template instance creation</li>
				<li>L6R.cpp - Contains 4 basic unit tests</li>
				<li>FunctionHeaders.txt - Contains the function headers and external contracts for two of the new capabilities you will be creating</li></ol></li>

<h3>2. L6 Statement of Work</h3>
<h4>2.1 Primary Objectives</h4>
<p>The primary objective of this lab is to provide you experience working with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Layering an operation (e.g., InjectCapability) on another already existing component (e.g., Queue)<br>
	Because these capabilities (enhancements to Queue) are layered, they will work with any Queue implementation that implements QueueKernel, i.e., Queue0, Queue1, etc.</li>
  <li>Adding new functionality to an already existing component</li>
  <li>The inheritance syntax used by C++ when layering a new operation</li>
  <li>C++ syntax used by the client program when adding additional capabilities to an already existing component
	<br>
	The approach used in L6 is a form of decorator pattern where the decoration occurs through template instantiation done at compile time </li>
</ul>
<h4>2.2 Specifics</h4>
<p><em>Steps</em>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start Visual Studio</li>
          <li>Open project L6R</li>
          <li>Find and open EnhancedIntQ.h </li>
          <li>Read the comments found in <em>EnhancedIntQ.h</em>.
			  <br>Begin from the top and follow the "To do" instructions as you find them.
			  <br>If you get in a hurry and try to skip the reading, things will end up going slower as compared to taking your time and reading the comments from the top
			  <br>This advice comes from the "Fast is slow, and slow is fast" principle
			  
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>Hints</em>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>AppendCapabilitiy1.hpp contains comments to explain the C++ syntax and how inheritance is working</li>
          
        </ul>
	
<p><em>Important Restrictions</em>:</p>
<ol>
  
  <li><strong>Use Design by Contract</strong> - No defensive programming for any of these operations </li>

<li><strong>Write elegant client code</strong> - Eliminate code duplication, have no unused variables, leverage Queue's public operations, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>About Making Copies</strong> - There should be no reason to make copies of any Queue or variable of type T, so don't</li>

</ol>

	
<h3>3. Testing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>L6 testing
    <ul>
      <li>These tests are minimal</li>
		
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you want to earn full credit for this assignment it is recommended that you add additional unit tests
	<br> Add your new and more thorough unit tests to L6R.cpp</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Grader's test cases</em>:</p>
<p>Grading will be done running a more complete set of unit tests which will systematically stress your implementations of InjectCapability, FindLocOfXCapability, and EqualCapability</p>

<h3>4. Submitting the Assignment for Grading</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Follow <a href="https://drholly77.github.io/CSSE373Pages/LabRelated/" target="_blank">VS2022 instructions</a> for <em>committing and pushing</em> your L6R project to your GitHub Education CSSE373 repo</li>
	<li>Use the commit message &quot;L6R final commit, ready for grading&quot;</li>
	</ul>
