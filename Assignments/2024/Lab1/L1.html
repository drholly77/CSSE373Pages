<h2>1. Command Interpreter Using an Array</h2>
<p>Make a command interpreter that works with an array of Sequences instead of
  just two Sequences.&nbsp; This permits the user at the keyboard to work with more than two 
  Sequences, and it actually reduces the amount of code in our command interpreter.</p>
<h4>Setup Steps:</h4>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">
	    <p>For Steps 1 - 5 (below) reference the following web page <a href="https://drholly77.github.io/CSSE373Pages/LabRelated/" target="_blank">Creating and building empty projects</a></p>
		  <ol>
          <li><strong>Create</strong> a new Visual Studio Empty Project, name the project <em>L1</em> and make it subordinate to the csse373devenv202430-YourUserID repo folder</li>
          <li><strong>Copy</strong> (don't move) two files: (1) the <em>driver.cpp</em> and (2) <em>TextSeq.h</em> from the <u>csse373devenv202430-YourUserID/SeqDriver</u> folder to the newly created
            L1 folder (VS created the L1  in Step 1)</li>
          <li><strong>Add</strong> .cpp files to your project's Source Files folder. First add the <em>driver.cpp</em> (that you copied) to the project's Source Files folder, then add the wrapper folder (VS calls it a filter) and its subordinate .cpp files. When finished with this step, your project should look like the screen shot to the right.</li>
          <li><strong>Add</strong> the <em>TextSeq.h</em> file to your project's Header Files folder.</li>
          <li><strong>Change</strong> the project settings</li>
          <li><strong>Build</strong> the project. If all steps up to this point were done correctly, it should build without any errors&nbsp;</li>
          <li>To run this program click: <em>Debug | Start Debugging</em> from the menu bar in Visual Studio</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overview of What To Do:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>driver.cpp</em> that you copied from the SeqDriver folder is a client program of the Sequence4 component</li>
  <li>Both client program and Sequence4 component follow the Design by Contract approach where the client program is responsible for making sure that the precondition (<em>requires</em> clause) for the called operation (from the Sequence component) is satisfied prior to making a call. Also, the Sequence component's exported operations do not check to make sure that the client has called correctly, they are implemented with the assumption that the client has called with all preconditions satisfied.</li>
  <li>The client program in <em>driver.cpp</em> works with two Sequences, s1 and s2</li>
  <li>Your job is to modify each of the <em>driver.cpp</em> operations that currently work with s1 and s2 so that after modification it works with one variable which is an array of Sequences instead of two distinct sequence variables</li>
</ul>
<h4>To Do Specifics:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Start at the top of <em>driver.cpp</em> with the &quot;#include&quot;s and the typedefs to create an array of Sequence's - see Example 2.1 (below)</li>
  <li>Then move on to <em>main</em> - see Example 2.2</li>
  <li>Then change all operations that  end up being called by <em>main</em>, e.g., the commandController,  the <em>do</em> operations, the file input and output operations, etc. - see Example 2.3</li>
  <li>Also, you must  modify <em>getIndex</em> - see Example 2.4 </li>
</ol>
<h2>2. Code Examples</h2>
<h3>2.1 - Creating a StaticArray of Sequences of Text</h3>
<p>Use the following example as a guide to creating an Array of Sequences, make these changes in  <em>TextSeq.h</em></p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
    <table border="1" width="55%">
      <tr>
        <td  valign="top"><code><font size="2">// Array of Sequence&lt;Text&gt;<br>
          // Date: 3/2022<br>
          <br>
          #<b>include</b> &quot;Sequence/Sequence4.hpp&quot;<br>
          #<b>include</b> &quot;StaticArray/StaticArray1.hpp&quot;<br>
          <br>
          // First create a named instance of Sequence that holds Text objects
			<br>
          <b>typedef</b> Sequence4 &lt;Text&gt; TextSequence;<br>
          <br>
			// No Magic Numbers allowed
			<br>
			// So use enum to give names to the array lower and upper bounds, and size
		 <br>
		  <strong>enum</strong> {lowerBound = 0, upperBound = 4, arraySize = 5};<br>
          // Create named instance called ArrayOfSequences, which is indexed from 0..4<br>
          <b>typedef</b> StaticArray1 &lt;TextSequence, lowerBound, upperBound&gt; ArrayOfSequences;</font></code></td>
   
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
</div>
<h3>2.2 - Changes to <em>main</em> - the <em>main</em> below has been completed, use it to replace L1's main in driver.cpp</h3>
<div align="center">
  <center>
    <table border="1" width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><code><font size="2"><b>int</b> main (int argc, char* 
          argv[])<br>
          {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; Boolean showMenu = (argc == 1);<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; ArrayOfSequences aS1;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; commandController (aS1, showMenu);<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; wcout &lt;&lt; "end program" &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>return</b> 0;<br>
          }	// end main</font></code></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
</div>
<h3>2.3 - Changes to <em>do</em> operations - the <em>doAdd</em> is completed, use it and then modify all other <em>do</em> operations similarly</h3>
<div align="center">
  <center>
    <table border="2" width="95%">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><pre><strong>void</strong> doAdd (ArrayOfSequences&amp; aS)
{
	Integer i, p;
	Text x;

	wcout &lt;&lt; "Add to ";
	i = getIndex(aS);
	p = getPosition(aS[i].length());
	getText(x);
	aS[i].add(p, x);

	wcout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "s[" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "].add(" &lt;&lt; p &lt;&lt; ", x); executed." &lt;&lt; endl;
	wcout &lt;&lt; "x = " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
}	// doAdd</pre></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
</div>
<h3>2.4 - Changes to <em>getIndex</em> operation</h3>
<p>Change <em>getIndex</em> (in driver.cpp) so that it requires the user to type in a
  number that can legally index into the ArrayOfSequences, but not allow indices 
  outside the bounds of the array</p>
<ul>
  <li>Change <em>getIndex</em>'s header to so that it takes the array of Sequences as a parameter - you can see a legal call to <em>getIndex</em> in the<em> doAdd</em> example above</li>
  <li>In <em>getIndex</em> use StaticArray's <em>getBounds</em> operation to determine the number of
    locations in the array, just in case we later decide to change the array size&nbsp;<br>
    <code>Integer lowerB, upperB;<br>
    aS.getBounds (lowerB, upperB);<br>
    // use lowerB and upperB to tell the user what the bounds
    are&nbsp;<br>
    // and to check to make sure the user supplied a good index</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Testing</h2>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><p>After a successful build, run your program by clicking <em>Debug | Start Debugging</em> from the menu bar in Visual Studio. This will bring up a window similar to the one to the right</p>
        <p>You can test the program at least&nbsp; 3 different ways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Run the program and type in commands at the command prompt to exercise each of the<em> </em>operations that were modified</li>
          <li>In the folder <em>csse373devenv202430-YourUserID/SeqDriver</em> there is a sub-folder called <em>TestScripts</em> which contains .txt files. Each .txt contains a sequence of command interpreter commands for the original SeqDriver implementation (which uses only two Sequences). If you utilize these test scripts, you'll need to first study them to understand what they are asking the command interpreter to do, and then modify them slightly to work with your command interpreter that uses an array of sequences. Instead of running and retyping commands, you can run your command interpreter and then copy and paste modified tests scripts into your command interpreter while its running. </li>
          <li>You can place them in  either the <em>L1/Debug</em> folder and run the command interpreter from a command prompt and use file redirection to feed your test scripts into your L1.exe. See the <em>Testing - With a Test Script</em> reference page.</li>
        </ol></td>

<h2>4. Grading</h2>
<p>In the folder csse373devenv202430-YourUserID/SeqDriver/TestFolder is <em>L1Sol.exe</em>. This executable is my solution to L1.</p>
<p>Your submission will be graded by running various test scripts against your <em>L1.exe</em> and then using FC (a File Compare tool) to compare the output from your <em>L1.exe</em> against the output from <em>L1Sol.exe</em>. FC does a character by character comparison.</p>
<p>It's highly recommend that you do not try to use the <em>eyeball method</em> compare your <em>L1.exe</em>'s output with the output from <em>L1Sol.exe</em> because FC detects all character differences, even whitespace differences. I recommend that you run both L1.exe and L1Sol.exe on the test scripts found in SeqDriver/Testscripts, and compare the two outputs against each other using FC. You are finished when FC reports &quot;no differences found&quot;.</p>
