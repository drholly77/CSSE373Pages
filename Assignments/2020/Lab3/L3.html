<h3>2. L3 Statement of Work</h3>
<h4>2.1 Primary Objectives</h4>
<p>The primary objective of this lab is to provide you experience working with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Layering a component (e.g., List) on another already existing component (e.g., Queue).</li>
</ul>
<h4>2.2 Specifics</h4>
<p><em>Steps</em>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start Visual Studio</li>
  <li>Open project L3D</li>
  <li>Find and open List2.hpp</li>
  <li>Implement a member function - think strategically, some need to be done before others in order to for a unit test's &quot;Test set up&quot; part to work correctly<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Hints</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>addRightFront() has been done for you - study the code in that operation to help you understand the <em>correspondence</em></li>
  <li>Reread the Component Layering slides from Week #4 on the CSSE373 Moodle site</li>
  <li>Reference the Queue and List specifications</li>
  <li>Implement all of List2's stubbed out member functions based on the instructional materials</li>
  <li>Look for the TODO comments in List2.hpp</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Important Restrictions</em>:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Obey the correspondence </strong>- When implementing the member functions you must obey the correspondence internal contract<br>
    That means: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>assume that the correspondence holds when the member function is called</li>
    <li>guarantee that the correspondence holds when the member function exits</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Use Design by Contract</strong> - No defensive programming of List's operations (see design-by-contract example below) </li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ul>
    <li>What this means is that the implementation of a List operation must not contain code that checks to make sure that the List operation was called correctly by the client</li>
    <li>Therefore, for all List operations that have a <em>requires</em> clause, you must program them with the assumption that their <em>requires</em> clause holds at the time the operation is called (like replaceRightFront, see Part 3 below)</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>No Cross Calling - </strong>None of List's member functions are permitted to make calls to any of the other <em>public</em> List member functions, i.e., no cross calling
    <ul>
      <li>For example, under this rule it is illegal for the <em>swapRights</em> operation to call any other List operation, e.g., <em>addRightFront</em></li>
      <li>All List operations (e.g.,<em> swapRights</em>) should directly manipulate List's data members (i.e., leftQ and rightQ) in order to satisfy the operation's <em>ensures</em> clause</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Calling Down</strong> - create private member functions that capture code that starts to appear in multiple different places in your List2 implementation and then instead of duplicating this code (i.e., having it appear in multiple different member function implementations) make a <em>call down</em> to the private member function from the public member function - this engineering technique is called procedural abstraction and the call is call <em>calling down</em> - for this assignment a private operation that can move items from one queue to second queue will come in real handy</li>
  <li><strong>No Recursion</strong> - None of List's member functions are permitted to be recursive</li>
  <li><strong>About Making Copies</strong> -
    <ul>
      <li>Copying the  data members <em>leftQ </em>or <em>rightQ</em> - When implementing List2's <em>operator =</em> you must use Queue's <em>operator =</em> to make a copy of <em>leftQ</em> and <em>rightQ</em>. Do not call <em>operator =</em> to make a copy of <em>leftQ </em>or <em>rightQ </em>in any implementation of the other List2 member functions - this is a performance constraint. If when implementing any other List operations you think you need to call <em>operator =</em> to make a copy of<em> leftQ </em>or <em>rightQ</em>, then rethink your algorithm until you figure out a way to not make a copy. Use transferFrom.</li>
      <li>Copying variables of type T - There is no need to make copies of the items being added or removed to the list. These are all items of type T. If you need to move items of type T from one variable to another, then call the <em>transferFrom</em> operation to do it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>3. Testing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>L3D testing first
    <ul>
      <li>These test against the List's internal representation, so these unit tests will only work with this particular implementation</li>
      <li>Look at these unit tests to better understand the correespondence between a List's abstract value and its internal representation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>L3R tesing second
    <ul>
      <li>These test at the abstract level only and would work for any List implementation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unfortunately the unit tests in L3D and L3R do not thoroughly test the List2.hpp member functions</li>
  <li>If you want to earn full credit for this assignment you must add more unit tests, particularly to L3D.cpp</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Use Boundary Condition Testing</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add/Remove/Access at the front, middle, and at the end of a List</li>
  <li>There are four addRightFront's unit tests - use these 4 different tests as a guide for boundary condition testing the other member functions:
    <ol>
      <li>adds an item to: (&lt;&gt;,&lt;&gt;) - incoming List is empty</li>
      <li>adds an item to: (&lt;&gt;,&lt;21&gt;) - incoming List has empty left and non-empty right</li>
      <li>adds an item to: (&lt;13,17,19&gt;,&lt;29&gt;) - incoming List has non-empty left and non-empty right</li>
      <li>adds an item to: (&lt;13,17,19&gt;,&lt;&gt;) - incoming List has non-empty left and empty right</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Notice that in both #2 and #4, there is only one item in the List's right prior to the call to addRight Front. If I were to add additional tests for addRightFront, I would vary #2 and #3 above by having more items in the List's right before the call to addRightFront. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><em>My test cases</em>:</p>
<p>When grading I will be running my own more complete set of unit tests that will systematically stress your member function implementations</p>
