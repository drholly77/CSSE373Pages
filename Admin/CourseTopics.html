<h1>CSSE373 Topics for  Spring 2019</h1>
<h3>Module related:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Design by contract which assigns responsibility for  the various parts of the contract</li>
  <li>Common math theories used for a horizontal  component base, e.g., string, integer, function, set, etc.</li>
  <li>Use math theories to model the abstract type for  a module, e.g., a math function to model a Map</li>
  <li>Minimalist approach for selecting a module&rsquo;s  primary operations</li>
  <li>Secondary operations</li>
  <li>Multiple implementations for an abstraction</li>
  <li>Layering one module on other modules utilizing  internal contracts such as abstraction functions and module invariants</li>
</ul>
<h3>Logic and proof related:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Predicate logic</li>
  <li>Logical implication, as well as logical <em>and</em> and logical <em>or</em>, etc.</li>
  <li>Quantification</li>
  <li>Direct proofs</li>
  <li>Trivial and Vacuous proofs </li>
  <li>Proof of recursive operations</li>
  <li>Loop invariant proofs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Write programs using C++ software components whose design is informed by concepts in Formal Methods</li>
  <li>Write programs using RESOLVE and Clemson's Web IDE</li>
  <li>Modular reasoning and how abstraction leaks make  reasoning not modular and harder </li>
  <li>Conventions for reducing/eliminating abstraction  leaks in components written in C++</li>
  <li>Write programs in C++: Client programs,  implementation of an abstraction using one or more other components â€“ get to  see/use see use internal contracts</li>
  <li>Implement some components that have seen in data  structures class, e.g., Map using hashing, Map using AVL/BST, Sequence using  AVL/BT</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compiler related:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Know the functioning of a verifying compiler at  a high level. </li>
  <li>Learn about basics of a traditional compiler</li>
  <li>Learn that the math theories need to be encoded  so that they can be fed into the compiler</li>
  <li>Learn what a verification condition is</li>
  <li>Learn a bit of the process of VC generation for  a small module and/or operation</li>
  <li>Work with several examples of loop invariants,  e.g., searching, sorting, an array, as well as loop invariants where the math  model is a string, e.g., on Queues, Stacks, Lists</li>
</ul>
<h3>Testing:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unit tests developed from a module&rsquo;s spec, often  referred to as specification-based testing</li>
</ul>
